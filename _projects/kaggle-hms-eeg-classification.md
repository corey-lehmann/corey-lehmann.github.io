## Summary
This project involves classifying EEG data to best match the diagnoses given by experts.

## Approach
I started this challenge by doing some initial data analysis and publishing some public notebooks to help people just starting. The links are below:
* [Plot spectrograms](https://www.kaggle.com/code/clehmann10/plot-spectrograms)
* [Solution scoring example](https://www.kaggle.com/code/clehmann10/solution-scoring-example)
* [Listen to spectrograms](https://www.kaggle.com/code/clehmann10/listen-to-spectrograms)

The third of these was just written for fun.

Following on from this, I published my exploratory data analysis - [Beginner's EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/code/clehmann10/beginner-s-eda).

I've seen a few different approaches to this challenge published on the public kaggle forums. The path that I'd like to try is to extract features into tabular format, then use XGBoost.

## Results
This challenge is still ongoing.
